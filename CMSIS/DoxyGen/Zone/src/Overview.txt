\b CMSIS-Zone defines methods to describe system resources and to partition these resources into multiple projects and execution areas. 
The system resources may include multiple processors, memory areas, peripherals and related interrupts. 
The system resources and partition assignments are stored in \ref zoneFormat (XML based). 

\b CMSIS-Zone includes a utility that manages these XML files. This utility:
  - displays all available system resources including memory and peripherals
  - allows to partition memory and assign resources to sub-systems.
  - supports the setup of secure, non-secure, and MPU protected execution zones with assignment of memory, peripherals, and interrupts.
  - provides a data model for generation of configuration files for tool and hardware setup.
  
The following diagram explains the development work flow when using the \b CMSIS-Zone management tool. 

\image html Partitioning_Workflow.png  "CMSIS-Zone development workflow"

The CMSIS-Zone utility reads a \ref rzone ".rzone" file that defines the overall system resources of an SoC system.
An interactive GUI supports the system partitioning. The assignments of the various partitions (also called zones)
saved in the \ref azone ".azone" file.

The combined information of resources and assignments can be exported to multiple \ref rzone ".rzone" files that represent a sub-system.
By using file templates the CMSIS-Zone utility can create tool or hardware configuration files.

It is possible to uses these steps multiple times which allows to split a complex SoC design with multiple processors into 
smaller sub-systems. For example a multi-core device can be partitioned in steps:
  - Step 1: split the multi-processor system into single processor sub-systems.
  - Step 2: create the partitions for secure and non-secure execution.
  - Step 3: configure MPU protected execution zones.

The following SoC diagram exemplifies step 1 and step 2 of this workflow.

The following sections explain: 
- \ref zoneToolUsage shows hot to use the CMSIS-Zone stand-alone tool to generate the relevant project information to be used
  in integrated development environments (IDEs).
- \ref zoneFormat (XML based) that stores system resource information and the configuration of project zones and execution zones.
- \ref GenDataModel which is used to create tool set-up files and hardware configuration files.

/**
\page UseCases CMSIS-Zone Use Cases

\b CMSIS-Zone simplifies to manage the complexity and the configuration of modern embedded systems that frequently include multiple processors and/or memory protection hardware.
It helps to split the embedded application various projects which creates the need to partition system resources.
And it simplifies the consistent configuration of access rights across the system, for example when using an MPU (memory protection unit).

The following section describes several uses cases that benefit from \b CMSIS-Zone.

\section UseCase_MPU MPU Protection

Focused on a single core microcontroller one might want to utilize the memory protection unit (MPU) capabilities
to segregate parts of an application. Thus the need to partition the system resources accordingly arises.

\image html mpu.png  "MPU Protection"

\section UseCase_TrustZone TrustZone Partitioning

TrustZone extensions add another degree of segregation which must be handled consistently.
In this case one has to handle MPU settings per security context and SAU configuration.

\image html trustzone.png  "TrustZone Partitioning and MPU Protection"

\section UseCase_MultiCore Multi-Core Partitioning

Beside traditional single cores asymmetric and hybrid multi-core devices contribute to increasing development complexity
for embedded systems. Having multiple cores running different parts of an application concurrently needs a well defined
resource assignment to prevent undesired misbehavior.

/**
\page zTUI User Interface

The CMSIS-Zone Utility user interface offers menus, toolbars, dialog boxes, and windows to manage the various aspects of your
project.


\section zTGUI CMSIS-Zone GUI

The utility's GUI provides menus for selecting commands and toolbar buttons in the \b Zone \b Editor window.

The picture shows the CMSIS-Zone utility with an opened .azone file, with the \b Zone tab selected:

\image html GUI.png


\subsection zTGUIButtons Toolbar Buttons

The <b>Zone Editor</b> window contains toolbar buttons that offer direct access to functionality of the utility:

\image html Buttons.png

| Button                | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Tree View             | Shows the resources as a tree |
| List View             | Shows the resources as a simple list |
| Arrange memory blocks | Arranges memory blocks according to their sizes |
| Add new zone          | Adds a new zone to the zone map |
| Generate              | Generates CMSIS-Zone output files |

\section zTUICreateProject Create a CMSIS-Zone Project

Currently, the flow is not complete. Please use one of the pre-built \ref zTExamples instead.


\section zTUIResources Memory and Peripheral Resources

The azone file has two tabs: \b Resources and \b Zones. The \b Resources tab shows all resources available to that system or
sub-system. The default view shows lists of memories, and peripherals. It also displays the available processor cores:

\image html MyProjAZoneOpen.png

We will revisit this view after we have created some zones in the next step.


\section zTUIPatitioning Zone Partitioning

To split a multi-processor system into single-processor sub-systems, you need to create new zones. Switch to the \b Zones tab
and click the <b>Add new zone</b> button:

\image html AddNewZoneButton.png

In the new window, you need to specify a name for the zone, select the applicable core, and choose the security level
(secure/non-secure). Here, we create a new zone that called "CM33_0" and is attached to processor core 0 without any security
attribute (not specified):

\image html NewZoneCM33_0.png

Next, create an additional zone called "CM33_1", attached to processor core 1, without security attribute.

\b Save your settings:

\image html  SaveButton.png


\section zTAssign Assign Resources to Zones

In a first step, assign resources to both processor cores. Based on this assignment, you can later add zones to each core and
assing the resources to these zones.

Using the check boxes in the \b Zones tab, you can assign resources to one of the processor cores or both:

\image html CoreResAsgn.png

Green entries show that a resource has been assigned to only one zone, while orange entries show assignments to both zones.

Save your work.

Next, click on the <b>Generate Code</b> button, to create separate rzone and azone files for the two processors. We need
them to further separate the zones.


\section zTUIGenerate Generate output

In Eclipse's Project Explorer, expand <b>MyProject - CM33_0</b> and double-click \c CM33_0.azone. The file opens in the
<b>CMSIS-Zone Editor</b>. You now only see the resources that are assigned to this processor:

\image html CM33_0Azone.png

Create the following:
- A zone called "Secure", with the security setting "Secure".
- A zone called "Non-Secure", with the security setting "Non-Secure".

\note

As we are now working with the first instance of the Cortex-M33 processor exclusively, you won't be able to assign these
zones to the second processor instance anymore.

In the next section, we will divide the memory blocks and assign them to these different zones.


\section zTAddMemoryBlock Add a Memory Block

Resources, such as memories can be divided into smaller parts. To create a new memory block, right-click on the memory that
you want to divide and select <b>Add memory block</b>:

\image html AddMemoryBlock.png

A new window opens. A name derived from the parent memory is already entered. Change it at your convenience. Specify the size
of the new block. In this dialog, you can set permissions, privilege, as well as security levels for the memory block. When
done, click \b Finish:

\image html NewMemoryBlockWiz.png

The new memory block is immediately shown in the zone map. Depending on the security level, you may be able to assign this
new block only to certain zones. For example, secure memory blocks cannot be assigned to non-secure zones. In this case, the
checkbox for the assignment is missing:
