\b CMSIS-Zone defines methods to describe system resources and to partition these resources into multiple projects and execution areas. 
The system resources may include multiple processors, memory areas, and peripherals. The system resource and partitioning information is stored in \ref XML_Format (XML based). 

\b CMSIS-Zone includes an interactive tool that manages files in the \ref XML_Format which allows to:
  - create system resource information from existing CMSIS-SVD and CMSIS-Pack descriptions.
  - partition system resources into various project zones.
  - partition a project zone into multiple execution zones.
  - generate various configuration files for tool set-up and hardware initialization.

The following diagram explains the development flow when using the \b CMSIS-Zone management tool.

The following sections explain: 
- \ref XML_Format (XML based) that stores system resource information and the configuration of project zones and execution zones.
- \ref GenDataModel which is used to create tool set-up files and hardware configuration files.


\section UseCases CMSIS-Zone Use Cases

\b CMSIS-Zone simplifies to manage the complexity and the configuration of modern embedded systems that frequently include multiple processors and/or memory protection hardware.
It helps to split the embedded application various projects which creates the need to partition system resources.
And, it simplifies the consistent configuration of access rights across the system, for example when using a MPU (memory protection unit).

The following section describes several uses cases that benefit from \b CMSIS-Zone.

\subsection UseCase_MPU MPU Protection

Focused on a single core microcontroller one might want to utilize the memory protection unit (MPU) capabilities
to segregate parts of an application. Thus the need to partition the system resources accordingly arises.

\subsection UseCase_TrustZone TrustZone Partitioning

TrustZone extensions add another degree of segregate which must be handled consistently.
In this case one has to handle MPU settings per security context and SAU configuration.

\subsection UseCase_MultiCore Multi-Core Partitioning

Beside traditional single cores asymetric and hybrid multi-core devices contribute to increasing development complexity
for embedded systems. Having multiple cores running different parts of an application concurrently needs a well defined
resource assignment to prevent undesired misbehaviour.
