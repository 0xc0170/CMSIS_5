\page packIndexFile CMSIS-Pack Index Files

CMSIS-Pack is designed as a web-based distribution  network. Each provider of a CMSIS-Pack
(also referred to as vendor) is responsible for hosting, maintaining and publishing unique versions of a CMSIS-Pack.

A CMSIS-Pack is uniquely identified by
\<vendor\>.\<pack name\>.\<version\>.pack
All published versions of a pack and the unversioned pdsc file need to be colocated in the same web folder specified by
\<url\>. Multiple different packs may be located in the same web folder.


\section pidxFile The Package Index File (pidx)

The package index file lists all CMSIS-Packs hosted and maintained by a vendor. The file is hosted by the vendor
and has the name \<vendor\>.pidx. The \<vendor\> tag needs to match the file name. The file also contains the 
\<url\> to it's origin as well as a \<timestamp\> of it's last update. 

It is the vendor's obligation to update this file whenever:
- a new pack is added 
- a new version of a pack is added
- a pack is deprecated
- a replacement for a pack becomes available

\b Example MyVendor.pidx:
\code

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

<index schemaVersion="1.0.0" xs:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PackIndex.xsd" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <vendor>MyVendor</vendor>
  <url>http://www.MyVendor.com/pack/</url>
  <timestamp>2017-01-25T15:00:10.7300074+00:00</timestamp>
  <pindex>
    <pdsc url="http://www.MyVendor.com/pack/mypack/" vendor="MyVendor" name="MyPack" version="1.1.0"/>
    ...
  </pindex>
</index>
\endcode

The individual pack's are referenced by the attributes:
- url= web folder where the pack's pdsc and packs reside
- vendor= vendor of the pack
- name= the name of the pack
- version = the version number of the latest available release for the pack

The package index file for the CMSIS-Pack compliant packs, hosted on www.keil.com can be found here:
http://www.keil.com/pack/Keil.pidx

The benefit of a single vendor index file is, that this file only needs to be exchanged once and can be
polled for any updates and additions of packs by a vendor.
A vendor needs to send an email to CMSIS@arm.com attaching a version of the \<vendor\>.pidx file to
register the file.



\section vidxFile The Vendor Index File (vidx)
The vendor index file lists package index files from different vendors. This information can be used
to compile a list of known packs.

\b Example MyVendor.vidx:
\code

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

<index schemaVersion="1.0" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xs:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="PackIndex.xsd">
  <vendor>MyVendor</vendor>
  <url>www.MyVendor.com/pack</url>
  <timestamp>2017-01-08T10:30:00</timestamp>
  <vindex>
    <pidx url="http://www.othervendor.com/MyPacks/" vendor="OtherVendor" />
    ...
  </vindex>
  <!-- the section below is only intended for the transition until all vendors use the <vendor>.pidx file
  <pindex>
    <pdsc url="http://www.othervendor2.com/packs/" vendor="OtherVendor2" name="MyPack" version="2.3.0"/>
    ...
    </pindex>
</index>

\endcode

The latest index file of CMSIS-Packs belonging to vendor="ARM" and vendor="Keil" that are hosted on www.keil.com/pack 
is maintained here: http://www.keil.com/pack/Keil.pidx

ARM also maintains a flat list of all CMSIS-Pack compliant packs reported to ARM here:
http://www.keil.com/pack/index.pidx. 
The vendor index file containing references to the vendor package index file (or optionally pdsc files) used 
for compiling this summary index file are listed in the Keil.vidx file and can be downloaded from here:
http://www.keil.com/pack/Keil.vidx

Based on these publically available index files everyone is equally positioned to create an index of available
packs and their latest versions.
